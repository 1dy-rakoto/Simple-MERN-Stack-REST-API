2. Set up a local MongoDB database or configure the connection to an existing MongoDB database by updating the database connection settings in the appropriate configuration file.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the project directory: npm install in the backend and frontend folder
4. Start the Node.js server in backend folder by running the following command:nodemon run dev
5. Access the REST API endpoints using a REST client (e.g., Postman) or via the frontend by running the following command:npm start in the frontend folder
